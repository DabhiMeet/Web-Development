	Hello Guys, I hope you are doing great in 2022. I am sure you all have already made your goals by now and thinking about how to achieve those goals. If one of your goals is to learn to code or to become a Web Developer in 2022 then I have something great to share with you today, the 2022 Web Developer RoadMap . </p>

	<p id="two">It's a collection of different paths to learning front-end, back-end, and all other things a Web developer should know. You will not just know about web development but about essential programming stuff which is important for all kind of programmers and software developers. </p>

	<p>
	The RoadMap is also divided into 3 sections, the first section is about common skills which every web developer should know, while the second and third section is about front-end and back-end development, two main areas of web development. </p>

	You can either learn Front-end or Back-end or both, depending upon your choice. If you want to become a FullStack Web developer then you have to learn both front-end and back-end, there is no escaping there </p>

	<p id="two">Btw, you might have seen this RoadMap before. This awesome visual guide to becoming a web developer was created by Kamranahmedse and posted on his GitHub repository here. It's one of my favorite places and I have bookmarked it for a repeated visit.

Last year, while doing some internet surfing I stumble upon this excellent page. I first found the DevOps RoadMap there and become an instant fan of Kamran Ahmed. In fact, I have these RoadMap printed and stick to my Desk for regular reference. </p>
